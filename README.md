# Women_Hackathon

Objective and dream of my project : The women who are studying can take advice from professional women and government
employee who are already experts in that field. So student women are seeking help from expert women.
Hence "For The Women , By The Women..!!".

I don't aim to form a project or product but a community of women around the globe who are helping each other and
learning from each other on voluntary basis.
